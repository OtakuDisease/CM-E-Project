    "# Cell 0 — Imports + financial helper functions (the “accounting layer”)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell sets up the Python environment and defines the *financial math* that later converts an hourly storage dispatch (which produces euros per hour) into a **net present value (NPV)** over many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What happens here\n",
    "- **Imports**: `numpy` (numerical arrays), `pandas` (tables/time series), `matplotlib` (plots), and `gurobipy` (Gurobi solver interface).\n",
    "- **Hard stop if Gurobi is missing**: the optimisation model is solved with Gurobi; without it the notebook cannot run.\n",
    "- **Defines helper functions** used by the optimisation objective:\n",
    "  - `pw_factor(r, H)`: the present-worth factor \\(P/A\\) that converts a constant annual cashflow into its present value:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    P/A(r,H) = \\sum_{k=1}^{H}\\frac{1}{(1+r)^k} = \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-H}}{r}.\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  - `pw_factor_shifted(r, H, start_delay)`: same factor, but cashflows start after a delay (e.g., commissioning delay).\n",
    "  - `pw_factor_growth_shifted(r, g, H, start_delay)`: present-worth factor when the annual cashflow grows by a constant drift \\(g\\) (used to model long-run price drift).\n",
    "  - `as_2d(a)`: forces vectors into a 2D array shape \\((S,T)\\) so “scenario × time” operations are consistent.\n",
    "  - `build_capex_multiplier_series(...)`: builds a year-by-year multiplier vector that tells the model **when CAPEX is paid** (multi‑year construction), **when it repeats** (replacements), and **how it changes by year** (either a constant escalation rate or an explicit year-index vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this cell exists (conceptually)\n",
    "Your optimisation has two time scales:\n",
    "1. **Operational**: hourly charging/discharging decisions over one representative year (\\(T=8760\\)).\n",
    "2. **Financial**: investment, O&M, subsidies and salvage over a project horizon of \\(H\\) years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper functions are what let the model say:\n",
    "- “This dispatch makes X €/year in *expected* operating profit”  \n",
    "  **and then**\n",
    "- “Over H years, discounted at rate r, that is worth PV = … € today.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation is important: it keeps the optimisation linear and interpretable, while still producing NPV (the metric you compare technologies on).\n"

    "1. **Loop over `TECH`**: for each technology name, call `solve_one_tech(...)`.\n",
    "2. **Store outputs** in `results` (a list of dictionaries).\n",
    "3. **Build a summary table** showing, per technology:\n",
    "   - solver status,\n",
    "   - best NPV,\n",
    "   - optimal design sizes \\(E, P^{ch}, P^{dis}\\).\n",
    "4. **Diagnostic re-solve when NPV is ~0**:\n",
    "   - If a technology chooses \\(E=P^{ch}=P^{dis}=0\\), its NPV will be close to zero.\n",
    "   - That does *not* necessarily mean the technology is “bad”; it can also mean “under current CAPEX/OPEX assumptions, investment is not justified.”\n",
    "   - To understand *why*, the code re-solves the model while forcing a minimum design size (e.g., ≥10% of upper bounds).\n",
    "   - It then prints the NPV breakdown so you can see which component dominates (CAPEX too high, low arbitrage value, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this is valuable\n",
    "This is a typical operations research workflow:\n",
    "- first obtain an optimal solution,\n",
    "- then run controlled counterfactuals to understand sensitivity and failure modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns the model into an explanatory tool, not just a black box that outputs a number.\n"
